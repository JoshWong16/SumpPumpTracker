# SumpPumpTracker

Goal 1: Create an app that notifies a user when pumps cannot keep up with rainwater and a flood may occur.

Goal 2: Track the performance levels of the pumps to determine when to replace them.

How to: 

The control panel for the pumps uses lights to signal when pumps are turned on and when water levels are threatening. 

Using an phone camera to detect when certain lights are on, that phone will notify the user's phone when water levels are high.
